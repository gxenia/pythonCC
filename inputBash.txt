To take the input for a program from a text file you need to use this command:

python3 program.py < directory/file.txt

- program.py is the program you are trying to execute
- directory is the directory where the files with the input are stored
- MAKE SURE THAT THIS DIRECTORY IS IN THE DIRECTORY OF THE PROGRAM
